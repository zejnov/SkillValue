//A number of sensitive cells are arranged in a circle and each one communicates with its two neighbors.
//In the sequence of cells, the first one and the last one are connected and are neighbors.

//A cell can have two states: "excited" or "quiet". "1" signifies that the cell is excited, "0" signifies that the cell is quiet.

//Given an initial configuration of excited and quiet cells, determine the configuration after K steps.

//Rules:

//If a cell is excited, it emits a signal received after one step by the two neighboring cells.
//Each cell gets excited when and only when a signal is received from only one of the neighboring cells.
//If a cell receives signals from both its adjacent cells, then the receiving cell will remain in (or it will transition to) the "quiet" state.
//Also, a cell transitions to the "quiet" state when it no longer has any excited neighbors.

//Input: array of numbers with the initial configuration({ 0,1}
//values).
//K > 0, K integer

//Output: array of numbers with the final configuration concatenated with commas.

//Example:
//If K = 2 and the initial configuration is 1,0,1,1 then:
//- the configuration after 1 step will be: 1,0,1,0
//- the configuration after 2 steps and the output will be: 0,0,0,0
